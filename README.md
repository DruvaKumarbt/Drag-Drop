# Drag-Drop

*Minimalistic idea on managing projects,drag and drop of projects which are completed to finished section.*
The project is built using typescript features and uses webpack to bundle.

Install the following dependencies using `npm install --save-dev "package"`

* lite-server
* webpack
* webpack-cli
* webpack-dev-server
* ts-loader
* typescript

**Run the project using `npm run build` which builds the project using webpack into bundle and then start the local server using `npm start`**
